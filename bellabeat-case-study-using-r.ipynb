Counting steps is a base feature that leads to other statistics such as calories lost, distance traveled and weight loss.\n\n76% of participants did not track their weight, more than 50% of participants did not track their sleep for more than 10 days, and more than 60% of participants did not engaged in healthy activity minutes exceeding 1,000 minutes a month. Based on these statistics, tracking steps is what’s important to participants.\n\nBellabeat can use this information and my analysis to promote their products, focus on promoting what features consumers look for in a fitness tracker, and showcase other features that stand out from the rest. Bellabeat can offer more than what your typical fitness tracker can and in a more comfortable way.\n\n\n7. Recommendations\n\nBellabeat is a wellness brand focused on women. With that being said, it is hard to analyze data with so many limitations and not knowing the genders of our participants. This knowledge would help us make better recommendations for Bellabeat. I would recommend that Bellabeat conduct it’s own survey over a longer period of time to produce more accurate data results.\n\n\nBy analyzing the smart device data that was suggested, these are my recommendation for Bellabeat to discover growth opportunities to improve the company and their marketing strategy:\n\n\n    Target Clientele - Knowing that the consumers of Bellabeat products are young adult women, discover advertising techniques targeting that demographic would be benificial.\n\n    Notifications -\n\n        Sending personalized notifications and messages makes a person feel more relevant and is more likely to be opened. This could be great motivation to perform the task that is asked of them.\n\n        Create a notification that alerts the person when they have been in a sedentary state for a long period of time during the day.\n\n        Remind them of their goals and suggest movement activity\n\n        Set up a weekly notification to record weight and reward them for doing so.\n\n        Promote healthy sleep habits with notifications suggesting winding down techniques, meditation, relaxing music or podcasts.\n\n        Notifications for drinking more water, bonuses if they have Bellabeats smart water bottle.\n\n    Social Media - Having a online community of women share their success stories, achievements, workouts, and meal plans brings more people together. Adding the ability to ask questions anonymously and creating challenges would be important too.\n\n    Challenges - Re-engagement after someone is sick or goes on vacation can be hard for that person to get back into routine. Creating different kinds of challenges can keep users interested and engaged. Continuous motivation is key when it comes to consistently tracking your health. Creating games to keep users maintaining healthy habits and reward them for passing challenges can keep people engaged too.\n\n\nPromote Bellabeat Products through social media reaching out to groups with women, companies that have fitness programs for employees, fitness facilities, and young moms. Bellabeat has many products that are amazing and not only help women track their health but are comfortable to wear.\n\nHaving the option to not wear something on your wrist constantly had me immediately interested. From personal experience, I hated wearing my fitness tracker to bed and I forget it sometimes when I put it on the charger. Having a necklace or clipping something to a shirt is a game changer. I’m sure I’m not alone with this feeling and many other women out there could benefit from knowing these items exist.\n\nBellabeats smart water bottle and products you don’t have to charge constantly like the Leaf or Time should be highly advertised. I look forward to seeing more of these products on the market soon.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# convert \"ActivityDate\" to datatime64 dtype and format to
